## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full-stack Web3 developer with a background in healthcare. My journey into tech began after six years as a Chiropractor, where I owned my own clinic. A fascination with blockchain technology led me to complete a two-year, government-funded course in full-stack development geared towards Web3/blockchain. I find joy in sharing my knowledge with others who are willing to learn.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a developer at 4 Plus Venture, where I serve as the Tech Lead/CTO for the Hokko NFT marketplace on the Sui blockchain.
- ðŸŒ± My present work involves building an NFT Indexer and Launchpad for Hokko.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for collaborations on the NFT Standard for Sui that i am developing, as well as other Sui-related projects.
